# CdkBugDemo - Memory Leak Bug

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3 and Angular CDK/Material version 8.2.3.  If I specify a drag boundary for a mat dialog, then SomeComponentComponent lingers in memory, even after the dialog closes.

Run `ng build` to build the project and `ng serve` to run it. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
